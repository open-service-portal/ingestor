# TEST ASSERTION - DO NOT BLINDLY REGENERATE
#
# Test: three-templates
# Purpose: Tests three-way YAML merge (default + download + pr)
# Scenario: yaml-merge
#
# This file contains the EXPECTED output for this test case.
# It should only be updated when:
#   1. Adding NEW features that intentionally change output
#   2. Fixing BUGS where the old output was incorrect
#   3. Modifying templates with a clear, documented purpose
#
# NEVER blindly regenerate this file without understanding WHY the output changed!
#
# To update after reviewing changes:
#   cp tests/output/yaml-merge-three-templates.yaml tests/yaml-merge/assert-three-templates.yaml
#
# This header will be stripped during test comparison.
